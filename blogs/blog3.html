        <p>
          There’s a certain thrill in turning an idea into something real — wires, code, motors, and all. For as long as I can remember, I’ve been obsessed with building things that <em>move</em>, <em>sense</em>, and even <em>think</em>. But robotics isn’t just my passion — it’s my language, my playground, and my classroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome inside the mind of a maker — where failure sparks curiosity, competitions fuel adrenaline, and every project teaches more than any textbook ever could.
        </p>

        <h2>✨ The Spark: Where It All Began</h2>
        <p>
          It started with <strong>simple circuits and a lot of curiosity</strong>. I was that kid who’d rather open up a toy to see how it worked than play with it. I still remember the first time I made an LED blink — it felt like magic. But it wasn’t long before blinking lights turned into <strong>line-following bots</strong>, <strong>sensor-based machines</strong>, and <strong>autonomous rovers</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Somewhere between solder burns and late-night debugging sessions, I realized — this is what I love. This is who I am.
        </p>

        <h2>⚙️ The Competitor's Fire</h2>
        <p>
          Robotics isn’t just about building machines — it’s about building <em>yourself</em>. I’ve had the privilege of competing in <strong>20+ national and international robotics competitions</strong>, from the high-energy arenas of <strong>IIT Bombay’s Techfest</strong> to the intense international challenges of <strong>Celesta IIT Patna</strong>, where my team proudly brought home the title.
        </p>
        <p>Each event taught me something new:</p>
        <p>
          <li><strong>Robo War:</strong> Raw power, durability, and strategic aggression.</li>
          <li><strong>Robo Sumo:</strong> Balance and low-end torque.</li>
          <li><strong>Robo Race:</strong> Precision, speed, and milliseconds that matter.</li>
          <li><strong>Cozmo Clench:</strong> A fusion of innovation and teamwork.</li>
        <p>Win or lose, every robot battle sharpened my mind and strengthened my resolve.</p>
        </p>

        <h2>📚 From Student to Teacher</h2>
        <p>
          At some point, building robots wasn’t enough. I wanted others — especially <em>young minds</em> — to experience that spark too. That’s how I stepped into the role of <strong>trainer and mentor</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through <strong>The BotMinds Robotics Team</strong> and <strong>EShikshalaya</strong>, I began conducting <strong>robotics and coding workshops</strong>, school visits, and training programs. Watching students see their first robot move? That’s a moment no trophy can match.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          A good maker doesn’t just build things — they build <em>others</em> too.
        </blockquote>

        <h2>🚀 Project Udaan: Engineering for a Cause</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most meaningful chapters of my journey has been <strong>Project Udaan</strong> — a mission to use engineering for real-world impact. The goal? To develop educational tools and robotic kits that are <strong>affordable</strong>, <strong>open-source</strong>, and <strong>fun</strong> for school students in Nepal.
        </p>
        <p>
          From designing custom Arduino shields to creating simplified learning guides, Udaan isn’t just a project — it’s a <strong>movement</strong>. We’re not just teaching robotics; we’re <em>igniting dreams</em>.
        </p>

        <h2>🧠 Lessons from the Maker's Mind</h2>
        <p>
          <li><strong>Curiosity is your superpower:</strong> <p>If something breaks — don’t fear it, explore it. Every mistake is a stepping stone to mastery.</p></li>
          <li><strong>Teamwork is underrated:</strong> <p>My proudest victories were never solo — they were earned with passionate, like-minded teammates who shared the same vision.</p></li>
          <li><strong>Give back early and often:</strong> <p>Teaching what you’ve learned not only helps others, it reinforces your own growth.</p></li>
          <li><strong>Projects > Grades:</strong> <p>Academic results are great — but what you build, share, and solve is what truly defines your skills.</p></li>
          <li><strong>Stay grounded, dream high:</strong> <p>Whether building with scrap parts or leading a robotics team, never forget why you started.</p></li>
        </p>

        <h2>🔧 The Journey Ahead</h2>
        <p>
          From blinking LEDs to mentoring young innovators, the path of a maker has taken me places I never imagined. With AI, space tech, and advanced robotics on the rise, there’s so much more to build and explore.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re reading this and wondering where to begin, here’s my advice:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
        Start with your curiosity. Feed it with action. Share it with others. And never stop making.
        </blockquote>
<p>Because inside every maker’s mind is a world waiting to be built.</p>
